  Only the $unset \"update operator\" is supported.
  http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operators/#update

  $unset allows to delete fields. To delete a field, specify :$unset as its
  new value. Example:

    (update user-component
            23
            {:password \"s3cret\" :password_reset_code :$unset})

  Notice that it's possible to delete fields in the same update as others are
  set.

  - :before-validation

  - :on-update-errors
  - :after-update

  All callbacks will be passed the `model-component` and the entire record
  with the corresponding attributes updated. The :validator callback must
  return a collection of errors (empty or nil if no errors), the other
  callbacks must return the entire record, maybe with some attributes
  changed, added, or deleted.

  With MongoDB's default ACKNOWLEDGED value for WriteConcern [^1], the
  :on-update-errors callback is called when there are network issues or
  database server errors (ex. com.mongodb.DuplicateKeyException).
